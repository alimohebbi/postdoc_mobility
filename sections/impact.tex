\subsection{Relevance and impact of the research }


Researchers focused on automated GUI testing in past decades as  suitable solution for reducing cost of integration testing, but the current solutions have not been wildly used by practitioners due to their limitations. 
Our approaches addresses the limitations and impact both research and industry as follows:

\textbf{Research:}

This project is an step toward mature  \testreuse approaches and it will impacts broader field of  GUI testing by following contributions:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item Proposes set of prompt patterns that formulates \testreuse as a prompt answering problem
\item Proposes strategies for building comprehensive \tam
\item Enhances effectiveness of semantic matching techniques.
\end{inparaenum}
The first two contributions impact model-based approaches.
First, integration of \tam in prompts opens direction of using LLM for model-based testing of application.
Second, a comprehensive model leads to higher coverage.
Effective semantic matching impacts Test Repair and Pattern-based test generation.
Test repair approaches find replacements for events that are broken in a test case between two versions of an app by matching the broken event to a semantically equivalent event in the new version~\cite{Choudhary:Water:ETSE:2011,Stocco:VisualRepair:FSE:2018,Pan:Meter:TSE:2022}.
Pattern-based approaches rely on semantic matching to match elements of an abstract pattern to actual events of the target application.

\textbf{Industry:}

\noindent
The approaches that we introduce in this project are applicable to all types of applications that include GUI interactions, such as E-commerce and mobile apps.
E-commerce sales exceeded 6 trillion U.S. dollars worldwide~\footnote{\href{https://www.statista.com/topics/871/online-shopping/}{E-commerce worldwide - statistics \& facts}} and
the mobile app market has reached revenue of 467 billion dollars in 2023~\footnote{\href{https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/app/worldwide}{Total revenue in the App market}}.
These commercial sectors are just a subset of industries that depend on GUI applications and financial cost of software failure is substantial in them.
In this project, we will create a standalone tool, \rltool, that developers can use to reveal functional faults and improve quality of software.
Ultimately, higher quality products increases businesses revenues.

Additionally, we will introduce an effective semantic matching technique that is applicable not only in testing, but also in business logic.
Many organization analysis available data on the web to make business decisions or provide insights. 
However, various sources may represent the same data differently that decreases accuracy of analysis. 
Semantic matching approaches that we propose in this project can be leveraged to overcome such issues.
