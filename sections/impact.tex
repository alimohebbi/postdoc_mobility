\subsection{Relevance and impact of the research }


In the past decades, researchers focused on automated GUI testing as a suitable solution for reducing the cost of integration testing. However, the current solutions have not been wildly used by practitioners due to their limitations. 
Our approaches address the limitations and impact of both research and industry as follows:

\textbf{Research:}

This project is a step toward mature \testreuse approaches, and it will impact the broader field of GUI testing by following contributions: 
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item Proposes a set of prompt patterns that formulates \testreuse as a prompt answering problem 
\item Proposes strategies for building comprehensive  \tam
\item Enhances the effectiveness of semantic matching techniques.
\end{inparaenum}
The first two contributions impact model-based approaches by:
First, integration of \tam in prompts opens the direction of using LLM for model-based testing of applications.
Second, a comprehensive model leads to higher coverage.
Effective semantic matching impacts Test Repair and Pattern-based test generation.
Test repair approaches find replacements for events that are broken in a test case between two versions of an app by matching the broken event to a semantically equivalent event in the new version.~\cite{Choudhary:Water:ETSE:2011,Stocco:VisualRepair:FSE:2018,Pan:Meter:TSE:2022}.
Pattern-based approaches rely on semantic matching to match elements of an abstract pattern to actual events of the target application.

\textbf{Industry:}

\noindent
The approaches we introduce in this project are applicable to all types of applications that include GUI interactions, such as E-commerce and mobile apps.
E-commerce sales exceeded 6 trillion U.S. dollars worldwide~\footnote{\href{https://www.statista.com/topics/871/online-shopping/}{E-commerce worldwide - statistics \& facts}}, and
the mobile app market reached revenue of 467 billion dollars in 2023~\footnote{\href{https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/app/worldwide}{Total revenue in the App market}}.
These commercial sectors are just a subset of industries that depend on GUI applications, and the financial cost of software failure is substantial in them.
In this project, we will create a standalone tool, \rltool, that developers can use to reveal functional faults and improve software quality.
Ultimately, high-quality products increase business revenues.

Additionally, we will introduce an effective semantic matching technique that is applicable not only in testing but also in business logic.
Many organizations analyze available data on the web to make business decisions or provide insights. 
However, various sources may represent the same data differently, which decreases analysis accuracy. 
Developers can leverage Semantic matching approaches to overcome such issues.
