                  generator for Java programs which is named
                  EvoSuite. The salient features of EvoSuite include
                  1) test suite generation based on evolutionary
                  algorithms and 2) mutation-based assertion
                  generation. The search based test suite generation
                  focuses on an entire coverage criterion, intead of
                  individual coverage goals. It can achieve higher
                  coverage than other search based techniques in
                  general. The assertion generation is an
                  implementation of the approach described in the
                  author's ISSTA 2010 and TSE 2012 papers. With a kind
                  of reduction, it can kill a large portion of mutants
                  with a relatively small number of assertions.}

                  Randoop. The core part of Randoop is a feedback
                  directed random test geneartion technique. Randoop
                  checks a group of default (implicit) contrast in
                  Java and .NET, including the properties of the
                  equals() methods and the absence of some runtime
                  exceptions. Moreover, Randoop optionally check the
                  consistency of behaviors of different versions of
                  the same APIs. Randoop uses several heuristic rules
                  to identify observer methods, records their
                  behaviors on specific inputs, and then uses the
                  recorded behaviors as regression oracles. },

 The analysis of so efficiency is based on the time needed to reach a certain confidence level on the SUT and on discoverinf a max number of faults in a give time.
 The analysis show that there is maximum analysis cost after which RT is more efficient than so. Since the cost is related to the size of the SUT this implies that there is a maximum program size for systematic techniques.},

        Typical smart home platform work at the "servant" level — highly dependent on user inputs with no predictions of human demands — which, if well addressed, would significantly widen their applicability. 
        In this article, the authors propose a human-centric smart home  energy  management  system  (SHE)  that  works at the “butler” level. 
        The system integrates ubiquitous sensing data from the physical and cyber spaces to discover the patterns of power usage and cognitively understand the behaviors of human beings. 
        The relationship between them is established to dynamically infer users’ demands for electricity, and then the optimal scheduling of the home energy system is triggered to respond to both the users’ demands and electricity rates. 
        The cyber space is represented by the users' interaction data on social network applications and is useful to understand online social behaviors in the virtual world, while the physical space is constituted by the motion sensors, GPS, and biosensors on wearable devices which let to track users' movements, locations, and sensations in the real world. 
        The extracted behavior information in cyber-physical space is further fused to recognize the relevant behavior contexts, which include *location* (where users are), *activities* (what users are doing or going to do), and *sensation* (how users feel about the environment). This allow the system to predict and perform more accurate inference of users'demands in smart homes and generate the optimal scheduling strategies of appliances, based on comfort as well as economy.

    comments  = {
        + Explore the context of people in the loop, which represents an important and relevant problem
        + Nice the abstract concept of butler assumed by the system and the comparison with that of servant, characteristic of non-intelligent systems
        + The papers seem to constitute more a vision than a real system. 
        + Although a case study is provided, no technical information is reported that allows the reader to understand how the system is developed and how it processes data and extracts information (it is all explained at a high level). This does not allow for system replicability.
        + The case study does not provide clear data on the accuracy of the predictions provided and on the effectiveness of the system. It merely reports a 14\% reduction in energy consumption compared to a non-intelligent system.

        In this paper the authors argue the need to provide IoT systems with the skills to understand, learn and think, which represent peculiar characteristics of cognitive science.
        For this reason they develop a new paradigm, called Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT).
        The authors describes the cognitive process from a bottom-up view, dividing it in four major layers: (i) sensing control layer, (ii) data-semantic-knowledge layer, (iii) decision-making layer, (iv) service evaluation layer. Moreover, they present a framework of CIoT which includes five fundamental cognitive tasks: (i) perception-action, (ii) massive data analytics, (iii) semantic derivation and knowledge discovery, (iv) intelligent decision-making, (v) on-demand service provisioning.
        For the massive task of data analysis, the authors underline the need to deal with a huge and heterogeneous amount of data, characterized by noises, incompleteness, errors, etc.
        Instead, for derivation and semantic knowledge, they suggest to exploit the intrinsic properties of ontologies and the methodologies of associative analysis, multilevel associations, multidimensional associations, quantitative associations and clustering analysis. Finally, for the intelligent decision-making, the authors show strengths and weaknesses of game theory, in contexts of local and global interactions.
        The papers ends with an analysis of the possible performance evaluation metrics in CIoT, distinguishing among (i) quality of data (QoD), (ii) quality of information (QoI), and (iii) QoE.

        The paper analyses the relationships between cyber-physical systems and human actors. According to the paper, the cooperation between human and technology will intensify in the next future and the boundaries between both actors will become blurred, so that we will turn from the concept of "human-computer interaction" to the concept of "human-computer cooperation".
        The communication between human and technological actors takes place in three different forms: (i) verbal and symbolic communication, (ii) action-related communication, and (iii) communication through anticipation. The verbal and symbolic communication requires a common language to establish it between the actors. However, communication problems can emerge if words and signs are linked to different meanings by the participants respectively, or if it is not clearly and distinctly understandable or understood which meaning is intended in a given case. Instead, the action-related communication highlights how non-verbal communication (represented by gestures, faial expressions, body posture) often accompanies verbal communication in the form of meta-communication but also has an important stand-alone function in situations where verbal communication is impossible. Finally, communication through anticipation refers to standardized behavior where actions can be anticipated before they are actually performed.
        Strictly connected with communication is the concept of knowledge. The authors distinguish among explicit and implicit knowledge. The explicit knowledge represents the engine which characterized the three types of communication mentioned above. Instead, the implicit knowledge is linked to practical action: it cannot be represented or communicated in an isolated, abstracted form. 
        Currents of thought distinguish a “soft” and a “hard” understanding of implicit knowledge. The "soft" understanding assumes that implicit knowledge exists in practice and play an important role in communication, but can be principally be made explicit. By contrast, the "hard" undestanding assumes that implicit knowledge exists that is not amenable to explication, so a transformation from implicit to explicit knowledge will be impossible or at least only possible to a very limited extent.
        Then the authors analyses the implicit knowledge features which characterize the three types of communication between human and techonological actors. Exposing the limits of human-technology communication, they leverages the fact that the design of communication is essentially oriented to explicit and explicable knowledge. Although a principal and conclusive answer to the question of whether it is possible to really register and simulate implicit knowledge, it can be stated that there are principally different challenges to this task and that it is much more difficult to obtain success here than in communication on the basis of explicit knowledge.

        + Explore the context of human-machine interaction, which represents an important and relevant problem in the context of smart cities.
        + The papers analyzes the forms of communication that characterized human-machines interactions, with a particular focus to the cyber-physical systems.
        + The papers distinguish between explicit and implicit knowledge.
        + The papers affirms that the potentials of technology are mainly located in the field of explicit knowledge, objectifivation, and formalization. The potentials of human labor capacity, by contrast, refer to the human ability to develop and make use of both explicit and implicit knowledge.
        + The papers attests that in the foreseeable future, technological systems will only to a limited degree (at best) be capable of registering and making use of implicit knowledge. This leads to a statement that at first view may appear paradoxical: the more the potentials of CPS are developed and used, the more a systematical re-investigation of the necessary cooperatino between humans and technology is indicated. Growing interlinkage, complexity and autonomy of technological systems does not reduce but rather increases their dependency on human action as their complement.

  interviewees said that their companies' UX work was 'exploratory using for 
  example prototypes and user stories instead of defining requirements'. 
  (2) 'Companies that work in a more data-driven way do not generally see the 
  product as finished when it has been released to market.' (3) Security and

  basically describes the states of a system. Each mode ranges over a discrete 
  set of values, e.g., a car may have an Ignition made with 'on' and 'off' as 
  possible values. Mode models are structured sets of modes, which are 
  represented by statecharts in the paper. The three approaches for mode model 
  elicitation presented in the paper use different sources of information as a 
  basis: (1) expert knowledge, (2) architecture of logical components, and (3)
  manual inspection of requirements. The authors demonstrate their technique

  summary = {The authors propose a new formal requirements modeling language, 
  which targets socio-technical systems/cyber-physical systems involving 
  probabilistic and timed aspects. There is also planned tool support, e.g., 
  for simulation and test-case generation. 
  Modeling is based on abstract contracts which allow to express uncertainties. 
  Furthermore, the proposed language allows to reason about model refinement, 
  i.e., to start with very abstract models and to incrementally add new details
  in a principled way. At the time of writing, this is work in progress. The 
  modeling language has been defined, but the corresponding tools are under 
  development.

  comments = {The paper considers systems that are interesting to us, but at the 
  time of writing the proposed modeling language and its accompanying tools are 
  hard to judge. We will need to look into the further development. From a 
  pessimistic point of view, it is just another formal modeling language and 
  its feature may also be modeled using (probabilistic) timed automata.

	abstract = {State-of-the art techniques for automated test generation focus on generating executions that cover program behavior. As they do not generate oracles, it is up to the developer to figure out what a test does and how to check the correctness of the observed behavior. In this paper, we present an approach to generate parameterized unit tests---unit tests containing symbolic pre- and postconditions characterizing test input and test result. Starting from concrete inputs and results, we use test generation and mutation to systematically generalize pre- and postconditions while simplifying the computation steps. Evaluated on five open source libraries, the generated parameterized unit tests are (a) more expressive, characterizing general rather than concrete behavior; (b) need fewer computation steps, making them easier to understand; and (c) achieve a higher coverage than regular unit tests.},

Parameterized unit tests separate two concerns: 1) They specify the external behavior of the involved methods for all test arguments. 2) Test cases can be re-obtained as traditional closed unit tests by instantiating the parameterized unit tests. Symbolic execution and constraint solving can be used to automatically choose a minimal set of inputs that exercise a parameterized unit test with respect to possible code paths of the implementation. In addition, parameterized unit tests can be used as symbolic summaries which allows symbolic execution to scale for arbitrary abstraction levels. We have developed a prototype tool which computes test cases from parameterized unit tests. We report on its first use testing parts of the .NET base class library.},
